let me start with i don't know\\
so that i start off right.

i think two introductions might be necessary here,\\
for the ramblings of jamal bernard gaddis.

i was born in a relaxed manner,\\
i remember well.\\
i was in a pleasant mood which made\\
its way here, and now to you,\\
obviously evolving on the way.

it won't be my intention\\
to trace that evolution, (though i would\\
definitely love to see what it looks like all\\
at once) and as we discussed, we recognize\\
that misunderstandings are connected to but are not\\
reflections of us,

neither showing nor symbolizing us,\\
which even we can't do,\\
my intention will be to embody\\
that which i must.
