i got people in my mind\\
that i think i wanna be like, when i think of growth.

people i think are more secure than me,\\
more in agreement with themselves.

there's me wondering whether i could really feel a\\
thing like that in another person, and me knowing\\
that everyone can and does, all the time, whether\\
they speak on it or not.

and then, either as a result or independent of the conclusions\\
of those wonderings, there is: what i will do.\\
and that's always there.

and things that are always there eventually ask\\
for a deepening; that anything that can be lost be treated as such.
