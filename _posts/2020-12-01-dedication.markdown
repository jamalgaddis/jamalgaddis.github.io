pain is familiar; never comes from\\
nowhere.

it is feeling undeniable.

and feeling we know swells and quiets but\\
never comes from nowhere and never\\
disappears and we know our only power in\\
this world is rearrangement

we cannot reduce to nothing

would the pain be less traumatic if we treated it like family?
