your brown frame gives me flashes of green

brown frames moving down the street\\
looking for, coming from green\\
and the colors that come from green

smelling and listening and looking being brown\\
amidst it all, underneath what we are\\
under, inside of what we are inside of,\\
next to each other for now in the face\\
of whatever we are in the face of.

i hope to spare pretention, vanity, i want to\\
move in necessary waters.
