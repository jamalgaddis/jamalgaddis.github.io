A little weed,\\
and some self confidence.

This music entering my ears,\\
and a rhythm flowing out of my hands and feet.

Maybe, they are connected,\\
but maybe they are connected only in the way that things\\
that aren't connected\\
are connected.

I can have fun because i say so,\\
not because it is what i am supposed to do. Likewise I will not succumb to your levity for levity's sake,\\
because for me and my spirit the task of bearing weight feels good to our conscious bodies.

I am constantly in love,\\
constantly effusing not only love but the\\
other things that have made their way into me --

Sita, it is my goal to let the bad flow out of me as well...i will practice wisdom but i will let it out,\\
because it must not be made to stay in.

Yasmin -- have my book ready, iá¸¿ coming to get it.
