my fingers look to another direction
for their motivation to move --
motivation shaping movement --
when i type directly on the computer keyboard.

i think it'll be alright as a diary though.

---------------

this back pain has revived thoughts of death and ability. 
i don't want to self diagnose as a goal, i want to use it as a basic tool, without thinking
because getting better isn't an option it's a convincing compulsion.

getting better is sticky, tho. i can feel myself getting tangled in it, stuck on it,
unable to ride the transition from awareness to new form.
