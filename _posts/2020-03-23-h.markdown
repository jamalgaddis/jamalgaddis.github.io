how did we used to be friends?
like _how_
did it used to be?

what would we say?
where did our eyes rest?
did we ever sit a moment in each other's company
thinking of being anywhere else?

i don't believe so.
i can admit though that time was holy then,
as i attest to living in unholy times now,

surviving on a dreamy suspicion
that someday, having thrown myself away
will come in handy,

but mostly quietly astounded;
controllably and covertly thrashing
in outrage with myself.
