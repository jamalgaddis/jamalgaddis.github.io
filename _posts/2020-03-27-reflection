people live in their own balance\\
(if only retrospectively)

when free.


boundary doesnt give the same feel\\
as\\
bondage, but i'm guessing the words share blood.

my blood and my brain tell me, even calmly,\\
that it is all to be treated the same, as\\
constriction upon freedom --

_indirect, too...contorted down a random form\\
_that at best is boring and ugly and at worst is\\
_hidden from my view.

anything that sees the thought through will admit\\
(at least for a moment) that everything finds its\\
own balance. what good then does the imposition\\
of balance serve?\\
i'm responsible for maintaining it, but did i invest\\
myself in the history of the particular boundaries i\\
uphold?

where does it come from. that is the demand i\\
have for anything mandated upon me.\\
if the answer is boring, or too complicated to\\
explain, or if it is hidden from me or cannot be\\
produced, then we have reason to evaluate.
