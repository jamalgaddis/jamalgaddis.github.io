people live in their own balance\\
when free.


boundary doesnt give the same feel\\
as\\
bondage, but i'm guessing the words share blood.

my blood and my brain tell me, even calmly,\\
that it is all to be treated the same, as\\
constriction upon freedom

(often indirect, too...contorted down a random form\\
that at best is boring and ugly and at worst is\\
hidden from view.)

anything that sees the thought through will admit\\
(at least for a moment) that everything finds its\\
own balance. what purpose then does the imposition\\
of balance serve?\\
and if i'm responsible for maintaining something imposed\\
on me, i should begin to wonder whether i'm personally\\
invested in its history.

where does it come from. that is the demand i\\
have for anything that asks for my cooperation.\\
if the answer is boring, or too complicated to\\
explain, or if it is hidden from me or cannot be\\
produced, then we have reason to re-evaluate.
