when things aren't adding up\\
being embarassed /

capoeira on the beach\\
Barra\\
pr√©-Covid\\
     and more      and\\
sandcolor and sunlight and\\
brown and more brown--\\
i was scared to start a ginga.\\
the wave was upon me from\\
her, and from the      the\\
wave was upon me and from\\
the brown. i suppose the golden\\
green was inside of me or\\
underneath us all, but i\\
didn't ginga, because       \\
while vibrations were upon me\\
i was adding things up.
