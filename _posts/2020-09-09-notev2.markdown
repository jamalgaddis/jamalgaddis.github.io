if there are forty rules of love then i am aboard\\
some type of vehicle that makes stops. if i am not\\
the authority then everything is as it is.

math, my timidity, the fact that i annoy people\\
and can watch one lizard for a long time. things\\
are moving along with the same amount of\\
mysticism the passing scent has always carried,\\
only consciousness has shifted; patience has\\
lost its shape;

death only exists in your mind, and you are\\
the one who loses.\\
be sad for no one, in anything you do. be sad\\
only when it is what you are in, and take pride\\
in what you see there, golden, worthy.
