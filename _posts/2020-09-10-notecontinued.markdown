death only exists in your mind, and you\\
are the one who loses.

you are not sure what you are doing, but\\
you tell yourself you are sure. you will\\
achieve what you know you can, suffocating\\
things you didn't know were breathing.\\
thinking you can't fly when you are simply\\
in the wrong place for it, creating a\\
cocoon not for transformation but\\
decomposition, labeled as loyalty, breaking\\
down like gum in a dry mouth.\\
just spit it out.

i am no better. but if your interest is in\\
protecting your ego then you have wasted\\
the words.
