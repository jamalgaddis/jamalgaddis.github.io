if there are forty rules of love then i am aboard\\
some type of vehicle that makes stops. if i am not\\
the authority then everything is as it is.

math, my timidity, the fact that i annoy people\\
and can watch one lizard for a long time. things\\
are moving along with the same amount of\\
mysticism the passing scent has always carried,\\
only consciousness has shifted; patience has\\
lost its shape;

death has entered only where you have allowed\\
your eyes to linger for too long, continuing\\
to look after you've already see -- you know\\
this is how what you call monsters are formed.
