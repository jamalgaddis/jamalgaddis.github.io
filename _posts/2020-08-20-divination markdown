Weed after time away from it, and some self confidence,\\
nossa.

This music entering my ears,\\
and a rhythm flowing out of my hands and feet.

Maybe, they are connected,\\
but maybe they are connected only in the way that things\\
that aren't connected\\
are connected.

I can have fun because i say so,\\
not because it is what i am supposed to do. Likewise I will not succumb to your levity for levity's sake,\\
because for me and my spirit the task of bearing weight feels good on our conscious bodies.

I am constantly in love, constantly incessantly effusing love\\
constantly in danger of putting coldness in between the warm parts of me,\\
hesitantly, and weakly letting out the other things that have made their way into me --

Sita, it is my goal to let the bad flow out of me as well...i will practice wisdom but i will let it out,\\
because it must not be made to stay in.

Yasmin -- have my book ready, iá¸¿ coming to get it.
